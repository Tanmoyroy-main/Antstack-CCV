Coupon Code Validator WebApp

---

Problem Statement
Create an application to create and validate the coupon codes that support given features.

Description
The endpoint should take the total amount of the cart and a coupon code (string) and return if the coupon code is valid or not
If valid, it should also return the discount amount that needs to be deducted from the total cart value.
Coupon Validation should include the following rules:
Coupons will have a start date and end date. Post end date, the coupon is considered as expired.
Coupon code can only be applied on a cart with a minimum amount defined for each of the coupons.
Coupon codes can be of two type
Flat discount, which will deduct a predefined amount from the total cart value
Percentage discount, which will deduct a percentage from the cart value. It should also define a maximum amount that can be discounted using this percentage discount.
It should also have endpoints to create and list coupon codes.
Build a minimal frontend to demonstrate the endpoints.

Instructions:
Solution should be built using NodeJS/Python(Backend) and React for Frontend.
Solution will not be considered if done completely with the help of the available NPM/PIP package.
Use any version control platform to share the completed code.
The Repository should have instructions on how to run the application locally.
Candidates are expected to handle minimal errors/corner cases that can occur when using the built application. If an application fails to run or crashes in an expected workflow, it would be rejected.
Host the application on any of the platforms and include a link to the solution along with the code.
Styling is not a major consideration for evaluation, minimal design is sufficient.
Plagiarism is not entertained, in case you refer to a code snippet from sites like stackoverflow, do comment the link and short description on what problem does it solve.
